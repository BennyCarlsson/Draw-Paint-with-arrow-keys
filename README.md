# Draw-Paint-with-arrow-keys


You need to use click on the move button on the right of the canvas to activate the move function and use the arrow keys to move it around the canvas.

You can click on the Draw button to start painting on the canvas by moving the arrow keys.

You can also play a small game by clicking on play a game button.

The game is like, boxes will be falling from the top and you need to overlap your square with the falling square and your score would get incrimented.

It should still be perfected.
